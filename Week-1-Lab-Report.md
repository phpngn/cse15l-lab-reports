# Week 1 Lab Report: Remote Access and the Filesystem

## Pre-task: Have your CSE15L account ready and make sure your local computer has OpenSSH 

* Check if your computer has OpenSSH installed. If not, install it [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse?tabs=gui).
* Look up your CSE15L [here](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php) and reset the account password.

## Step 1: Installing VSCode in your local computer
VSCode has the terminal that allow you to access your remote system. Open your browser and go to the official website for VSCode [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Select the right version for your OS, install it and set it up on your computer. 

Once you are finished, the program  should look similar to this:

## Step 2: Connecting to your remote system

Run VSCode and open a new terminal. Enter the following command:

    ssh your_CSE15L_account@ieng6.ucsd.edu

Remember to replace your_CSE15L_account with your actual account. If you enter it correctly, the terminal will ask for your password. Enter the password and you should be able to log in.

**However, this is the part where I got stuck since I have never successfully log in. I have reset the password during the lab on Wednesday, wait it out and it did not work. I tried to log in again that night without success. So on Thursday I did a global password reset, including changing the AD password, and by this time on Friday, I still cannot log in.** 

**I will continue trying to log in during the weekend. If I still have not success, I will contact the IT service or go to the OH next week to seek help.**
